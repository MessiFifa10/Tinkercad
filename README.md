This repository provides a guide to help you get started with designing circuits using Tinkercad. 
</p>

## Prerequisites

- A web browser
- A free Tinkercad account (sign up at [Tinkercad](https://www.tinkercad.com/))

## Steps to Get Started

1. **Sign Up / Log In**
   - Visit [Tinkercad](https://www.tinkercad.com/) and create an account or log in.

2. **Create a New Circuit**
   - Click on the "Circuits" tab.
   - Select "Create new Circuit."

3. **Add Components**
   - Use the component library to drag and drop components like resistors, LEDs, and power sources onto the workspace.

4. **Connect Components**
   - Use wires to connect your components. Click on a component's pin and drag to another component's pin to create a connection.

5. **Simulate the Circuit**
   - Once your circuit is complete, click the "Start Simulation" button to test it.

6. **Save and Share**
   - Save your project and share it with others using the share link.

## Example Project

Check out the `examples` folder for a basic LED circuit example.
